# Playlists App
[https://arko-playlists.web.app/](https://arko-playlists.web.app/)
## Introduction
This app allows users to create and manage their own music playlists. Users can log in to their accounts, create new playlists, add songs, and upload images for playlist covers. Additionally, users can view playlists created by other users on the home page.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to solidify concepts related to Vue.js and Firebase, with a specific focus on integrating Firebase storage. I aimed to build a polished and user-friendly application: smooth UI, useful error messaging, loading spinners, theme picker. Additionally, the project served as a refresher on Firestore and Storage rules.

## Potential Improvements
If I had more time, I would feature/change the following:
- Allow editing existing playlists (title, description, image, song order) 
- Enable lazy loading and add loading content placeholders
- Test and expand on accessibility features

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- Vue.js
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
